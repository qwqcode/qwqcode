### Hi there, I am qwqcode 👋

- 🛤 I’m currently studying in a unknown high school as a senior three students.
- 📝 I’m currently learning conventional curriculum in an ordinary Chinese school.
- ⚔️ I'm addicted to computer science and various digital-related products and technologies.
- 🌅 I also love photography and design, watching anime and music.
- 💦 I'm always sleepy (or you can buy me boba to wake me up!)
- 🥪 I ~may~ (will) be a full-stack programmer.
- 👀 I have taught myself a lot of computer programming languages and knowledge about computer over these years.
- 🚲 Always spanning back and forth between the web front-end and the back-end.
- 🌚 But what I learned was not systematic actually.
  - That is to say, it is not very professional.
  - Therefore, must work harder to improve my knowledge.
- 🤔 I'm looking for help on how to get into a not-too-bad university.
